86. Partition List

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.


class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode beforeHead = new ListNode(0), afterHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode before = beforeHead, after = afterHead;
        for (; head != null; head = head.next)
            if (head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = head;
            } else {
                after.next = head;
                after = head;
            }

        after.next = null;
        before.next = afterHead.next;
        return beforeHead.next;
    }
}
