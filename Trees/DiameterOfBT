543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


class Solution {
    int d=0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        height(root);
        return d-1;
    }
    int height(TreeNode node){
        if(node==null) return 0;

        int lh=height(node.left);
        int rh=height(node.right);
        int dia=lh+rh+1;
        d=Math.max(dia,d);
        return Math.max(lh,rh)+1;
        }
}
