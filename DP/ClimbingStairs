70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=2) return n;
        int one=1,two=2;
        for(int i=1;i<=n-2;i++){
            int temp=one+two;
            one=two;
            two=temp;
        }
        return two;
    }
}
